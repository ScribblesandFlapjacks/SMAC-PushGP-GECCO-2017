\section{Indtroduction}

Set up SMAC, what we did with it, and what we learned.

\todo{The following could be moved to Background if we think it makes more
	sense there.}
It is important to keep in mind that there is little in this paper that is
specific to SMAC or its details or, for that matter, Clojush or its details. 
There are many approaches to parameter
tuning, and presumably similar results could have been acquired with many of
them. What matters the most here is that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item SMAC was able to discover parameter settings that 
	\emph{substantially} improved the performance
	of Clojush on the Replace-space-with-newline problem.
	\item Applying those optimized parameter settings to a variety of other
	problems let to very mixed results, suggesting that those parameter
	settings were very specific to the particular problem used for the SMAC
	search.
\end{itemize}
The fact that SMAC was able to discover settings that improved
performance on the Replace-space-with-newline problem by such a wide margin
is quite impressive. The fact that those parameter settings don't appear to
generalize is in no way the ``fault'' of SMAC, and are likely much more 
about how we used the tool than any property of the tool itself.

\section{Background}

This is pretty fuzzy to me (Nic). We don't need to say a lot about \emph{how}
SMAC works, but we do need to talk about \emph{what it does}. Maybe that just
gets blended into the introduction?

Somewhere we'll presumably need to acknowledge that (a) there's been lots of
work historically on parameter optimization (e.g., early work on things like
population sizes and mutation rates in GAs) and (b) SMAC is by no means the
only tool of its kind out there. It would be great if someone could do some
lit review on that latter question in particular. (A few early examples would
be sufficient to make the first point; the latter is more politically charged.)

\section{Tuning parameters for Replace-space-with-newline}

Describe the August work in Morris.

\section{Applying those parameters to other problems}

Describe Tom's subsequent work applying those parameters to 4 other
problems.

\section{Discussion}

Talk about what we learned and what this means

\section{Future work}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Use SMAC to tune parameters on the other four problems one at a time, and see how that works on the other problems.
	\item Use SMAC to tune on (sub)sets of the problems, like all 5, or on subsets that seem similar (or different) based on the individual tuning.
	\item etc.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}

Evolution is complicated!
