```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Load, extend, and reshape the data

```{r}
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
operator_counts <- read_delim("~/Documents/Research/SMAC-PushGP-EuroGP-2017/data/operator_counts.txt", " ", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)

# Compute the total number of "children" in this ancestry tree.

operator_counts$Total = operator_counts$Random + operator_counts$Uniform.mutation + operator_counts$Uniform.close.mutation + operator_counts$Alternation + operator_counts$Alternation.Uniform.Mutation

# Reshape the data into the "long" form

long_counts <- gather(operator_counts, Operator, Count, Random:Alternation.Uniform.Mutation, factor_key=TRUE)

# Add proportions

long_counts$Proportion = long_counts$Count / long_counts$Total

long_counts$Treatment <- factor(long_counts$Treatment)

# Remove the "Genes" filter because that just clutters things

long_counts <- subset(long_counts, Filter != "Gene")

long_counts$Filter <- factor(long_counts$Filter, levels = c("Ancestry", "Instruction", "LastGen"), ordered=TRUE)
```

## Plot the proportions

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# '{:alternation 0.04 :uniform-mutation 0.36 :uniform-close-mutation 0.06 [:alternation :uniform-mutation] 0.54}'

smac_settings <- data.frame(
  Operator = c("Random", "Uniform.mutation", "Uniform.close.mutation", "Alternation", "Alternation.Uniform.Mutation"),
  Proportion = c(NA, 0.36, 0.06, 0.04, 0.54)
)
smac_settings$Treatment = "SMAC"

# {:alternation 0.2 :uniform-mutation 0.2 :uniform-close-mutation 0.1 [:alternation :uniform-mutation] 0.5 }

standard_settings <- data.frame(
  Operator = c("Random", "Uniform.mutation", "Uniform.close.mutation", "Alternation", "Alternation.Uniform.Mutation"),
  Proportion = c(NA, 0.2, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5)
)
standard_settings$Treatment = "Standard"

run_settings = rbind(standard_settings, smac_settings);

ggplot(long_counts, aes(x=Filter, y=Proportion, color=Treatment)) + geom_boxplot() + facet_grid(. ~ Operator) + geom_hline(aes(yintercept = Proportion, color=Treatment), run_settings) + theme_bw() + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=30, hjust=1))
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
